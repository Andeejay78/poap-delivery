## Intro
To celebrate the successful launch of the Eth2.0 multiclient testnet Medalla, and to encourage as much community engagement as possible, we have teamed up with our friends at [beaconcha.in](https://medalla.beaconcha.in/) and [r/ethstaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker) to create and distribute badges that will prove via the Ethereum Blockchain that you participated in the launch of the multiclient testnet.

To distribute the badges in a quick, efficent and affordable way, the Air-Drop will be done using Merkle trees and leaving the user the chance to claim them whenever they want.

## Project structure
### ETH

### App

### Merkle Tree
